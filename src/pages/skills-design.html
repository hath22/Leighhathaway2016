            <p class="leader">Nothing gives me greater satisfaction than to create something that is both functional, user-centric and beautiful. Of my various disiplines, my primary passion is for visual design.</p>

            <p>The following list of design tools are my weapons of choice for tackling all design work. Some tools I utilise on a daily basis and in which I have developed a high level of expertise, whilst other tools are employed as required. Please see below for details:</p>

            <h3>Adobe Illustrator</h3>

            <p>Illustrator makes it on my list of three things I would take to a desert island. I initially used it solely for vector illustration and icon design, but over the past two years I have been primarily using it for wireframing and UI design.</p>

            <h3>Adobe Photoshop</h3>

            <p>Photoshop is the tool that first drew me into the design world. I've solidly used it every day for over 10 years and despite its bloat, is still the most all-round tool for any task.</p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>

            <p>Broadly skilled in both development and design, I'm experienced enough with CSS to use it for designing in the browser. Whilst not as free flowing as traditional design tools, I find there's significant benefit to viewing design features as the user does, particularly when it comes to font rendering.</p>

            <h3>Sketch</h3>

            <p>I feel Sketch is the future of UI Design and I'm investing time in learning this beautiful piece of software. I haven't had the opportunity to switch my working practice over to Sketch, but anticipate doing so in the very near future.</p>

            <h3>Adobe InDesign</h3>

            <p>My InDesign skills come from previously working with a print-focused company that required all website designs to be printed and marked up by the marketing team. As such, I'm experienced at setting up grids, creating master templates and working with the linked assets.</p>

            <h3>Adobe After Effects</h3>

            <p>My experience with After Effects is specific to creating animated prototypes of user interface interactions to help clients visualise the final outcome.</p>

            <h3>Lightroom</h3>

            <p>I use Lightroom to manage my photography collection, particularly with the batch processing of large numbers of RAW images. I find the image adjustment tools within the application are as powerful as Photoshop and significantly more efficient.</p>
