            <p class="leader">Nothing gives me greater satisfaction than to create something that is both useable and beautiful. Of my various disiplines my primary passion is for visual design.</p>

            <p>The below list of design tools are my weapons of choice for tackling all design work. Some I use many times a day and consider myself an expert in, whilst others come up on an as needs basis. Please see below for details:</p>

            <h3>Adobe Illustrator</h3>

            <p>Illustrator makes my list of three things I can take to a desert island. I initally used it solely for vector illustration and icon design but over the past two years have primarily been using it for Wireframing and UI design.</p>

            <h3>Adobe Photoshop</h3>

            <p>Photoshop is the tool that first drew me into the design world. I've solidly used it almost every day for over 10 years and dispite it's bloat is still the most all round tool for any task.</p>

            <h3>CSS</h3>

            <p>Straddling the line between development and design i'm very comfortable enough with CSS to use it for designing in the browser. Whilst not as free flowing as traditional design tools I find there's significant benefit to seeing things as the user does, particular when it comes to font rendering.</p>

            <h3>Sketch</h3>

            <p>I feel Sketch is the future of UI Design and i'm investing time in learning this beautiful piece of software. I haven't had the opportunity to switch my working practise over to Sketch however am hoping to in the very near future.</p>

            <h3>Adobe InDesign</h3>

            <p>My InDesign skills come from previously working with a print focused company that required all website designs to be printed and marked up by their comms team. As such i'm comfoirtable with setting up grids, creating master templates and working with the linked assets. Currently I use it mainly for document design however if light on bitmap images still lean toward Illustrator.</p>

            <h3>Adobe After Effects</h3>

            <p>My experience with After Effects comes specifically from prototyping UI transitions for client demonstrations. I appreciate the software goes far deeper than my knowledge extends however i find i can get everything i need out of it with the knowledge i have.</p>

            <h3>Lightroom</h3>

            <p>I use Lightroom to manage my photography collection, particularly with the batch processing of large numbers of RAW images. I find the image adjustment tools within the application are as powerful as Photoshop and significantly more efficient.</p>
