            <p class="leader">Safer together is a government initiative to take a new approach to bushfire risk management under the newly formed Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p>

            <p>The project was to provide a website for the Safer Together initiative that presented valuable information to a wide spectrum of users, from general public to industry experts.</p>

            <h3>My Involvement</h3>

            <p>I first became involved with this project at the <strong>visual design</strong> stage where I took completed wireframes and built up polished designs using Adobe Photoshop.</p>

            <p>The final design deliverables included 6 different templates and 3 mobile responsive designs.</p>

            <p>Following the sign-off of design I lead the front-end development and eventual implementantion of the site in Squiz Matrix.</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>

            <p>Safer Together although a new entity came with basic colour branding from it's parent government department but everything else was open to exploration.</p>

            <p>To best display the map, chart and graph heavy content we opted for a modular system where a suite of predefined layouts allowed content authors to best display their data alongside supportive text.</p>

            <p>In some sections of the site we knew there would be large amounts of text around a number of subsections, so to provide the best reading experience I opted for generous padding in and around each module giving greater focus to content.</p> 

            <p>The highest value content on the site are the charts and graphs so a large effort was put into making the charts accessible, easily digestable and aesthetically appealing.</p>

            <p>Below you will see the final Homepage design: </p>

            <h3>Development</h3>

            <p>I cut the designs using SASS to produce final responsive HTML and CSS. The development was managed through Github with the back-end development team working on javascript and server side functionality.</p>

            <p>Squiz Matrix doesn't accomodate modular authoring out of the box so during the implementation phase I pioneered a way to use the standard page metadata for authors to easily create and manage modules without web development skills.</p>

            <p>Finally as part of the sitewide handover I wrote the site authoring guide and conducted Squiz Matrix training with the clients content authoring team.</p>

            <h3>Live site(s)</h3>
            <p>The Safer Together website went live in January 2016, and can be viewed at <a href="http://delwp.vic.gov.au/safer-together">delwp.vic.gov.au/safer-together</a></p>
            <p>Further to this we were engaged to create a new portal for the Forest Fire Management Victoria presence based on the template used for Safer Together. You can view this page at <a href="http://delwp.vic.gov.au/ffmvic">delwp.vic.gov.au/ffmvic</a></p>
