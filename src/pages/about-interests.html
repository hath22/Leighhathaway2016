            <p class="leader">I find having interests outside of work very important as a source of inspiration for design work and of solutions to work problems whilst undertaking another activity.</p>

            <p>My interests include:</p>

            <h3>Foosball</h3>
            <p>When I arrived in Melbourne, there were no formal foosball (table soccer) meet-ups so I created a club in St Kilda. This quickly escalated into running the state-wide organisation, overseeing several clubs and national tournaments. As a player, my highest rank has been #2 in Australia and #134 in the world.</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>Design is more than work for me. I passionately follow a number of design blogs and look for any opportunities to practise new techniques.</p>

            <h3>AFL</h3>  
            <p>I enjoy following the North Melbourne AFL team and during the summer I partake in an evening AFL 7's league. In 2015 I represented Wales in the AFL World Cup and played in the wins over the Netherlands and Ethiopia.</p>

            <h3>Tabletop gaming</h3>
            <p>I regularly play tabletop boardgames, preferring the social and tactile nature of modern board games to computer gaming.</p>
