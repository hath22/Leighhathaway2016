            <p class="leader">The Victorian Environmental Water Holder (VEWH) is an independent statutory body responsible for holding and managing Victoria's environmental water entitlements.</p>

            <p>The project was to transform the site from a tool for industry experts to a promotional tool and an information resource for the general public.</p>

            <h3>My Involvement</h3>

            <p>Initially I was involved in presenting user workshops and created animated prototypes of interface interactions using After Effects to help present UI concepts to the client.</p>

            <p>My primary responsibility was in the visual design stage where I created polished designs from wireframes using Adobe Photoshop.</p>

            <p>Following the design, I was heavily involved in the development and subsequent handover phases.</p>

            <h3>Design</h3>

            <p>The final design deliverables included eight different templates, three mobile responsive designs, a kitchen sink page with all site modules laid out for easy reference, and a pattern library of type styles, colours and various interaction states.</p>

            <p>I created high impact pages that generate an engaging experience, whilst accomplishing the client's primary purpose of promoting the benefits of environmental water.</p> 

            <p>Below you will see the final Homepage design: </p>

        <div class="large-7 large-offset-2 medium-10 columns">

            <h3>Development</h3>

            <p>I was also recruited to assist the development team with the implementation of the website in Squiz Matrix CMS. This included constructing site templates and building pages to easily enable the client to make future site updates.</p>

            <p>Finally, as part of the sitewide handover, I wrote the site authoring guide and conducted Squiz Matrix training with the client's content authoring team.</p>
