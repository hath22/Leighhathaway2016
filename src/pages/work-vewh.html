            <p class="leader">The Victorian Environmental Water Holder (VEWH) are an independent statutory body responsible for holding and managing Victoria's environmental water entitlements.</p>

            <p>The project was to provide a completely new website for VEWH that met the goal of repurposing the site, from a tool for industry experts, to a digestible information source for the general public.</p>

            <h3>My Involvement</h3>

            <p>I first became involved with this project at the user experience stage in assisting the Experience manager with user workshops. As a part of this I created a few animated prototypes of interface interactions using After Effects to help present UI concepts to the client.</p>

            <p>My primary responsibility was the <strong>visual design</strong> stage where I took completed wireframes and built up polished designs using Adobe Photoshop.</p>

            <p>The final design deliverables included 8 different templates, 3 mobile responsive designs, a kitchen sink page with all site modules laid out for easy reference, and a pattern library of type styles, colours and various interaction states.</p>

            <p>Following the sign-off of design I was heavily involved in the implementation of the site in Squiz Matrix, assiting the front-end development team in constructing the site templates.</p>

            <p>Finally as part of the sitewide handover I wrote the site authoring guide and conducted Squiz Matrix training with the VEWH web team.</p>

            <h3>Design considerations</h3>

            <p>The VEWH had access to some fantastic imagery that was not being used on any digital medium. I utilised these to create high impact pages that help provide an engaging experience for public users which helps illustrate the benefits of environmental water.</p> 

            <p>Below you will see the final Homepage design: </p>
